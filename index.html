     		Everything gets better with coffee!<br> Going to work, working, not working, reading a book, walking a dog, drawing. Coffee even turns doing nothing into pure poetry!</h1>

     	<h1><span>Music Festival</span><br>
     	A music festival is a community event oriented towards live performances of singing and instrument playing that is often presented with a theme such as musical genre (e.g., blues, folk, jazz, classical music), nationality, or locality of musicians, or holiday.</h1>

     	<h1><span>Discovering new paths</span><br>
     	We know that as humans, we have a natural tendency to keep things as they are, holding it steady, smooth sailing and watching out for the waves! Sometimes, we allow obstacles to become so big in our minds, that the sheer size of them inhibits us from moving forward and, ultimately keeps us, consciously or unconsciously, in our very (un)comfortable “I don’t know” zone</h1>

     <section class="section_five">
     	<h1><span>Wondering Around</span><br>
     	Because “seeing is believing,” the first and most essential step in making it happen is by visualizing it! Visualization is a powerful tool and you can use it by picturing your perfect scenario, your dream, your goal or however you want to define it.</h1>

     <section class="section_six">
     	<h1><span>Happy times</span><br>
     	All humans have a tendency to be a bit more like Eeyore than Tigger, to ruminate more on bad experiences than positive ones. It’s an evolutionary adaptation-over-learning from the dangerous or hurtful situations we encounter through life (bullying, trauma, betrayal) helps us avoid them in the future and react quickly in a crisis.</h1>

     	<h1><span>Back to  Work</span><br>
     	Chances are you’ll be greeted by piles of unopened mail, files, and other office items sitting on your desk. Rather than ignore these items, take a few minutes to process them. Open envelopes, chuck junk mail, file items, and place items in your inbox.</h1>
